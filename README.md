Spiral of Theodorus or Square Root Spiral is constructed by consecutive right triangles where each hypotenuse becomes the base of the next triangle, with leg lengths of 1, resulting in hypotenuses of $√1$, $√2$, $√3$, . . . . . ., $√17$. Usually $√17$ is last one because hypotenuse of $√17$ is of last triangle which doesn't cause overlapping in the spiral structure.
